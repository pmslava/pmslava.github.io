      <description>Hello tennis friends!&#xA;As you know, I love playing tennis and live in Novi Sad, Serbia. Due to the recent changes at the Sajmi≈°te tennis club, many of us are wondering what the future holds for tennis in Novi Sad. How many more courts will be destroyed, and what will the court prices be? I think nothing good awaits us in the future. Tennis, like any other sport that requires a lot of land, cannot exist without state support in a situation where land prices are so high and the average income of the population is so low.</description>
