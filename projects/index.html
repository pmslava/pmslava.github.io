<p>LeadFrog is a SaaS platform designed for events and exhibitions that prioritizes the efficiency of face-to-face communication. It enhances the quality and speed of business interactions for attendees and visitors, reducing the process time by up to 83%. This results in a more effective and efficient event, as evidenced by our 86% retention rate due to the quality of our product.</p>
<p>Our product consists of a PHP-based back-end, Android and iOS applications for events, and a web front-end for user and company accounts.</p>
<p>In my role, I am responsible for developing the product and communicating with investors, clients, technical directors, analysts, designers, marketers, sellers, and team leaders. I am involved in all stages of the product development process, from market research and MVP development to technical support and user experience analysis.</p>

<p>ECBMarket is an electronic component marketplace for both manufacturers and consumers, based on PHP. Its essential features include customized search and navigation, seller listings, admin and user interfaces, social connectivity, messaging and notifications, mobile-friendly design, analytics dashboards, and user support.</p>
<p>The platform consists of a back-end and web front-end, but currently lacks mobile applications.</p>
<p>In my role as project manager, I was responsible for supervising three different companies. I collaborated closely with various stakeholders, including the product owner, users, development team, marketing team, support team, and engineering team to guarantee the platform&rsquo;s success. One of my notable accomplishments was achieving an average release time of 2-3 weeks for the platform, despite the challenges posed by the involvement of a government-based institution among our three primary groups.</p>

Role: Project manager</p>
<p>Despite not being a logistics expert, I was brought in to salvage a stalled implementation project.
